Analysing User Behaviour on Instagram with SQL
I have worked on a project hosted by [Hi Counselour](https://hicounselor.com/projects) throught Linkedin.

I have enjoyed on this project, because this aim to improve my skills cleaning datasets, conectting to database and write some queries to get different insights from data. They gave to me CSV and I had to envolved myself for working on them. Each CSV, content each table where we are working, and we selected only the useful columns for geetting the queries...
Applying the Knowledge during my Bootcamp and data analysis, we could show insights and help businesses and stakeholders to achieve greater success on our business case and the app.
